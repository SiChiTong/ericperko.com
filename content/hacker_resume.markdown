### CWRU Hacker Society ([goto.case.edu](http://goto.case.edu/), 2008-2011)

For the past two years, [Tim Henderson](http://www.hackthology.com/) and I have organized the CWRU Hacker Society, a student group dedicated to education, collaboration, and general hackerism. There are weekly tech talks by students, entrepreneurs, engineers from local companies, and other interesting/interested people.

### Space Train ([download](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/360865/Space%20Train.zip), 2010)

Led a team of 10 to make a point-and-click adventure game in three months as part of a college course. It is short, about 45 minutes if you do absolutely everything. (Adventure games are hard to make!)

### Python game programming tutorial ([link](http://www.steveasleep.com/pyglettutorial), 2008)

Written because no one else wrote it first and it needed to exist. Comes with a video of me nervously giving a talk based on the material.

### steveasleep.com ([Github](http://www.github.com/irskep/steveasleep), 2007-2011)

This web site is redesigned in 2-day spurts every 8-12 months. It has run on Wordpress and Django, currently runs on Flask and Google App Engine.

### Splatterboard ([download](http://www.steveasleep.com/download), 2008)

Drawing program, mostly a platform to mess around with funky brushes.

### gw0rp ([download](http://www.steveasleep.com/gw0rp), 2008)

Concept for a shooter with a unique (and hard-to-use) control scheme entered in [uDevGames](http://www.udevgames.com). It placed in a couple of categories.

### Tyregexaurus Reg ([Github](http://www.github.com/irskep/t-reg))

### JTrie ([Github](http://www.github.com/irskep/JTrie))

Disk-based string indexing structure optimized for search.

### SourceQL

Automatically mines data from DVCS repositories. The only publicly available part is a series of papers written for university courses. We (Tim and I) intend to publish a useful version soon.
