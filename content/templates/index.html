    <div class="about">
	    I'm Eric Perko, a graduate student at <a href="http://cwru.edu">Case Western Reserve University</a> working on an M.S. in Computer Science. I've been focusing my degree on robotics and artificial intelligence and am finishing up an MS thesis that addresses precision navigation for a robotic wheelchair. As part of that work, I've been leveraging the <a href="http://ros.org">Robot Operating System</a> as well as contributing open source code to the ROS community.
