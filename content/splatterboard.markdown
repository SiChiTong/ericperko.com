Splatterboard is a drawing program along the lines of the original Kid Pix. It is under development, but currently provides:

* ~13 brushes
* ~5 kinds of paint fills
* Stamps, mostly from [PDClipArt.org](http://www.pdclipart.org/)
* Multiple levels of undo
* A handful of primitives
* Various other tools

[Download for OS X](http://filer.case.edu/srj15/download/Splatterboard.zip) (It runs on Linux and Windows, but I only update the OS X package.)
