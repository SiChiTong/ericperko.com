Escort a convoy of supply ships across hostile waters with your futuristic airborne fighter.

Escort Wing is a fantastic game, and Will Hogben is primarily responsible for it. I contributed about 10% of the contest code as well as the music. The original game was made for a three-month contest held by [iDevGames](http://www.idevgames.com/) in October 2005, but Will and an active community have continued to develop it since then. Will is currently working with Freeverse Software to develop Escort Wing 2.
