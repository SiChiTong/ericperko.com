### Precision Navigation

This is my thesis topic. The goal of this project is to solve some of the issues our group has seen when attempting to using existing navigation algorithms for our smart wheelchair. This involves a number of different topics, including precision localization, precision path following and dynamic path planning.

You can find a video of some of the current functionality on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/chadrockey87#p/a/u/2/Ly1ot7R1Tlw). This video demonstrates the precision navigation taking predetermined goals (as output by a speech recognition module) and following a path precisely in order to achieve the desired position. You'll also note some of our early work interfacing the robotic platform with our "Smart Door" as a first step towards full integration with a "Smart Building".
