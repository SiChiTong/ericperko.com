## Part 5: Next Steps

I bet you thought I was going to tell you how to finish the game. Well, I'm not going to, and here's why:

1.  You wouldn't learn much
2.  I'm out of steam
3.  You don't need me

So instead of walking you through a standard refactoring session, I'm going to leave it as an exercise for you to do the following:

*   Make the Score counter mean something
*   Let the player restart the level if they die
*   Implement lives and a Game over screen
*   Add particle effects using [Lepton][1] or your own particle engine

Good luck. If you have trouble, you can try emailing me. I don't get much email from strangers, so I'll be happy to help you. Maybe your question will help me fill out this tutorial.
