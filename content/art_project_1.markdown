Art Project 1 is a procedural pretty-thing generator written in [Processing](http://www.processing.org/). You can [play with it here](http://filer.case.edu/srj15/ArtProject1) or leave comments on its [OpenProcessing.org page](http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=241).

If you want to be able to save an image to PDF, you'll have to download the source code, stick it in your own Processing project, and flip the "isApplet" variable.
